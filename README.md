#One Dimensional Shooter Simulator 
**Project Summary:** Shooter game where the player is only allowed to shoot in a one dimensional manner. There are there levels: 
- 1 versus 1, where two players using different keys on the keyboards face each other and attempt to deplete each others health as fast as posssible 
- Survival, where one player acts as the killer who can instantly kill the other. The other (blue) player must survive for 60 seconds to win. 
- Singleplayer, Player will need to kill small enemies before they make it to the end. If the enemies make it to the end then the player will lose health and more enemies will spawn in random positions. The player will lose once all their health is depleted. The objective is to both survive for a longer period but also to gain a high score, as each kill is 100 points to your score. 

**Motivation:** The primary motivation of this project was to further familiarize myself with Pygame as I had done a similar project using Java/Processing in school, which can be found [here](https://github.com/AnindD/ICS3U1-Culminating).
